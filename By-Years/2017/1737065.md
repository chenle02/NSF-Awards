Humans are modifying marine food webs both from the top-down, by reducing
consumer abundances, and from the bottom-up, by adding nutrients to coastal
habitats. Predicting these impacts is complicated because herbivores affect
primary producers both from the top-down, by eating them, and from the bottom-
up, by recycling nutrients and facilitating the recruitment of algae into local
marine ecosystems. This project uses experimental manipulations along a natural
gradient in nutrient availability on the California coast to evaluate the
complex interactions between top-down and bottom-up processes in marine
communities. This project includes experiments and outreach in a location with
substantial exposure to the public, and the investigators will work with
community and university outreach personnel to communicate this research to
broader audiences. Specifically, the project includes mechanisms for curriculum
development and outreach and will train undergraduate and graduate students in
marine science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are implementing a suite
of innovative approaches to understand the multiple roles that herbivores play
in marine systems. Traditional experimental methods for herbivore removal result
in the loss of both the consumptive and facilitative effects of herbivores. In
contrast, the investigators' experimental design allows them to partition the
different effects of herbivores on marine primary producers. These methods,
including observations, experiments, and modeling approaches, allow researchers
to (i) calculate the relative importance of herbivores' consumptive and
facilitative effects on algal diversity and abundance; (ii) determine the
effects of temperature, nutrients, and herbivores on the microbial community;
and (iii) evaluate the relative importance of internal processes and spatial
subsidies.
