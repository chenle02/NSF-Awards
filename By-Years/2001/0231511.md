ABSTRACT 0231511 Nicholas M. Pattrikalakis Mass Inst. of Tech

We propose to study the topology of the union of a finite collection of boxes
that covers an intersection curve in the plane and in 3D space. The
representation of curves that are the result of surface intersections is nearly
never exact, and thus certain approximations schemes are employed. The result is
often a piecewise linear approximation cl, which lies within a certain
neighborhood N, of the actual curve c. Much of the research in this area has
been focused on the approximation cl of c and how c and cl are/are not similar.
We propose to develop suficient conditions on the collection of the boxes and
the intersection curve, so that the resulting union of the collection is a
topological manifold homotopically equivalent to the given curve. In the case
where the curve has no self-intersections, this collection can serve as another
means of representing the curve, and thus this new representation can be used in
a variety of engineering applications. We believe this to be an innovative
exploratory study appropriate for SGER funding.
