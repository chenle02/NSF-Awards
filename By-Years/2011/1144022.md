&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) project is to provide a theoretical framework for advancing
the state-of-art of the conceptual design of compliant systems. The goal of this
work is to (i) develop a kinetostatic synthesis theory for the concept
generation of compliant mechanisms, (ii) gain a fundamental understanding of
compliant mechanism design problems by seeking their entire solution via
computational algorithms based on globally convergent polynomial solvers, and
(iii) explore the use of virtual reality (VR) environments for the interactive
design of compliant mechanisms. The educational objective is to stimulate the
interests of K-12, undergraduate and graduate students in learning engineering
subjects through the introduction of virtual reality to different levels of
design courses, an Innovation Challenge summer course, and a unique Virtual
Reality Demo Day program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will
result in a set of conceptual design tools that overcome the shortfalls of
existing approaches and enable the automatic function-to-form transformation in
the design of compliant mechanisms. These tools will increase the ability of
industry to design high performance compliant machine devices used in the fields
of manufacturing, robotics, automobile and defense etc. This in turn will help
the U.S. maintain its economic leadership and sustain its share of high-
technology jobs. The proposed educational program will change the stereotypical
image of engineers in young children, attract more high school students pursuing
degrees in engineering disciplines and educate globally competent design
engineers for industry. &lt;br/&gt;
