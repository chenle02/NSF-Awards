The purpose of the conference, to be held in Banff, Canada, September 30 through
October 5, 2001, is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for emerging
technologies related to microgravity research. The effort will be directed
towards bringing together scientists from the fluid, thermal, biological and
materials sciences and exchange technical information on research related to
transport processes in these disciplines. In particular, the focus will be on
complementing the technical expertise across these various areas, and exploring
the avenues for interdisciplinary work. The growing interdisciplinary aspects of
research in these different disciplines necessitates the sharing of expertise,
and the proposed conference will provide the forum for focusing on new areas
where experts will be able to blend their scientific ideas to deal with various
unsolved scientific problems. The funds will help support travel for U.S.
participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows, and non-tenured faculty with limited research funding.
