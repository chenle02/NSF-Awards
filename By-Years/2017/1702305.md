This project will further the understanding of symmetries as a fundamental tool
to organize structures in mathematics. The PI will bring new methods and results
in representation theory, which is the mathematical study of symmetries via
linear algebra, using higher categorical and homotopical methods. In the
process, the PI will develop new computational approaches and new combinatorial
objects are expected to arise.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will
topologically enhance classical structures in algebra in order to analyze
symmetries and fixed points, with the ultimate aim of resolving some fundamental
questions in representation theory. A key goal of the project is to make
progress in the understanding of simple modules and decomposition matrices of
finite groups of Lie type using perverse equivalences. The PI will work toward a
proof of Broue's abelian defect group conjecture via Deligne-Lusztig varieties.
This will require developing new homotopical methods to deal with certain fixed
point constructions. The PI will also investigate genericity properties and look
for combinatorial objects to encode numerical information.
