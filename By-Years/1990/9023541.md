This research consists of work on: (1) Interpenetrating polymer networks-their
synthesis, characterization, microstructure, electrical conductivity of iodine-
doped samples and the computer simulation of their formation and properties; (2)
Template effects on copolymerization; (3) The study of polymer dynamical
relaxation times by biased sampling Monte Carlo simulations; and (4) The effects
of large static or dynamically induced anisotropy on polymer systems. In each of
these topics they will stress the influence of polymer architecture and
isomerism (including topological isomerism). This research is a combined
theoretical and experimental project designed to relate physical properties with
the molecular architecture of polymers.
