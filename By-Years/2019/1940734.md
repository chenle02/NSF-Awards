A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 47th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages
(POPL), the premier conference on the foundations of programming languages. The
conference will be held during Jan 19-25, 2020, in New Orleans, Louisiana. This
award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives
priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop
in addition to the POPL conference. The impact of the award relates to
broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to
receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in all aspects of programming
languages and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
