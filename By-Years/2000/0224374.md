ABSTRACT

OCE-0224374

Under this award, the American Institute of Biological Sciences will continue
its management of the Dissertation Symposia on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO),
which it has run under joint NSF/ONR/NOAA sponsorship since 1978. From the time
of its inception twenty-four years ago, the objectives of DISCO have been (1) to
bring together in a common forum recent doctoral recipients in chemical
oceanography to discuss their cutting-edge dissertation research and (2) to
encourage the formation of long-term scientific collaborative relationships
early in their professional lives. DISCO has been a resounding success -- so
much so that the enthusiastic publicity generated in the academic community led
to DISCO becoming the de facto gold standard that led to the organization of
other DISCO-like dissertation symposia in other branches of the earth sciences.
