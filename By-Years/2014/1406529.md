Homotopy theory is the study of properties of mathematical objects which remain
invariant under deformation. Historically, homotopy theory emerged from
algebraic topology, which is the study of topological spaces (roughly, geometry
in which there is a notion of closeness but not distance) through algebraic
invariants; gradually, however, it has found applications much more broadly
throughout many areas of mathematics, especially algebraic and differential
geometry, and has many interesting connections to physics. Part of the reason
for this is that focusing on deformation-invariant properties of mathematical
objects makes both classifications and calculations much more tractable. The
interaction goes both ways; recently algebraic and geometric methods have found
powerful applications in homotopy theory, and much recent research has been
concerned with the algebro-geometric and higher-categorical nature of
homotopical objects, illuminating many structural aspects and inspiring further
interactions between these various mathematical disciplines.

The purpose of this project is to employ algebro-geometric and higher-
categorical techniques in the study of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.
The first goal is to study algebraic K-theory and related theories such as
topological Hochschild homology, as well as more general motives arising in
algebraic geometry, with emphasis on developing computational methods through
identification of localization sequences. The second aims to classify thick
subcategories of certain stable higher categories, especially those which arise
in geometry by formation of perfect complexes over various classes of derived
schemes. The third involves elliptic cohomology and is concerned with the
explicit description of the elliptic cohomology of various orbifolds and is an
important example of the not yet fully understood stable homotopy theory of
orbifolds, also known as global stable homotopy theory, another subject of much
recent attention. The final goal is to understand the units of a derived scheme
using the emerging tools of derived algebraic geometry, in particular the Picard
and Brauer groups and their higher categorical analogues and possible
connections to topological field theories.
