9318449 Reading Further development of the independent particle model and
correlation effects in atom-ion collisions are proposed. A many body
perturbation approach through second order will be used to study a number of
collision problems of theoretical and experimental interest. The forced impulse
method will be extended to lower energies and to other two electron processes in
He and H2. Excitation, ionization and double ionization effects will be examined
during the term of the grant. ***
