This is a travel grant to support approximately a US delegation of approximately
12 specialists to the 2nd International Conference on Smart Materials and
Nanotechnology in Engineering (SMNE2009) in Weihai, China. The international
conference consists of sessions in bio-inspired materials and structures, shape-
memory alloys and polymer, electro-active polymer, piezo-materials, electro and
magneto restrictive materials and fluids, fiber optic sensor, MEMS sensors and
actuators. The proposed group travel support would promote the international
collaboration in research and education in this very rich interdisciplinary
research area, in developing complementary approaches that are mutually
beneficial, and accessible to the growing community, and contribute to the
progress of nano science and engineering related to mechanics, materials and
sensors.
