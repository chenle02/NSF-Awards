9405710 Ruiz This award provides partial funding for the support of a technician
assigned to the William M. Keck Isotope Laboratory in the Department of
Geosciences at the University of Arizona. The laboratory operates a negative
ionization thermal mass spectrometer (NTIMS) and an inductively-coupled plasma
mass spectrometer with a laser ablation source (LA-ICP-MS), and has a heavy
analytical work load of measurements from NSF-funded research projects dealing
with fundamental problems in the origin of mineral deposits, crustal and mantle
petrogenesis, tectonic evolution of North America, origin of volcanic provinces
and sedimentary basins, and the geological dating of diamonds. ***
