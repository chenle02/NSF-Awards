Abstract Oikhberg

The PI plans to continue his work on several aspects of geometry of operator
spaces. One line of work deals with separable extension properties. Here the
most intriguing problem is whether K (the space of compact operators on a
separable Hilbert space) is complemented in every separable operator space
containing it (this is a "non-commutative" version of a classical result of
Sobczyk). A related issue is giving a complete description of separable locally
reflexive operator spaces which are completely complemented in every separable
locally reflexive operator superspace (an operator space counterpart of Zippin's
characterization of the space of convergent sequences). Another direction of
research is the study of maximal operator spaces (quotients of duals of
commutative C*-algebras). The PI plans to determine the cardinality of the set
of n-dimensional subspaces of maximal spaces, as well as the structure of
n-dimensional subspaces of the dual of a 2n-dimensional commutative C*-algebra
(in the spirit of Kashin's work). Possible applications of the proposed research
include better understanding of the structure of function spaces, of the space
of operators on a Hilbert space, and Banach space geometry in general
(extensions of local reflexivity).

One of the key mathematical tools of quantum mechanics is replacing scalars
(numbers) by operators on a Hilbert space (they can be thought of as infinite
matrices). Further exploration in this direction led to the development of the
theory of C*-algebras, and, later, to the introduction of the notion of operator
space (also called "non-commutative" or "quantized Banach space"). One can view
an operator space as a Banach space with additional structure, induced by its
embedding into the C*-algebra B(H) of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert
space H. The investigation of operator spaces has advanced very rapidly over the
last ten years, combining ideas and techniques from Banach space theory and the
theory of C*-algebras. It has already produced answers to some long-standing
problems of Operator Theory. The proposed research deals with two themes: the
existence of non-commutative analogs of classical Banach space results; and the
use of Banach space methods in the operator space case. If successful, this
research will advance our understanding of connections between Banach and
operator spaces, and potentially, enhance our knowledge of physical phenomena.
