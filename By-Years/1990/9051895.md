A new course whose purpose is to teach scientific problem solving with
microcomputers will be developed. This course would be taken by undergraduates
whose intended degrees are in nontechnical areas. The goal is to teach
nonscientists the principles involved in problem solving in scientific
disciplines. The use of computers will allow the students to attack a wide range
of modern and topical problems, which would otherwise be inaccessible.
