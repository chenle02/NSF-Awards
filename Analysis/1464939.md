This grant supports U.S. participation in the conference Complex Analysis and
Dynamical Systems VII, held in Nahariya, Israel, from May 10-15, 2015. The
conference is organized jointly by a group of scientists at Bar-Ilan University,
Hebrew University, ORT Braude College and the University of South Florida. This
international event will be the seventh in the popular series of conferences on
Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems. The participants will be prominent
scientists, young researchers, and students from the US, Canada, the European
Union, Eastern Europe and Asia. The presentations at the conference will range
from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in Complex
Analysis, Dynamical Systems, and Mathematical Physics, in a form accessible to
advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on
focused research topics. Supporting the travel of young researchers and graduate
students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America,
Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are spending all
their waking hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment will, as
it has done in the past, inspire many beginning researchers, including
minorities and members from underrepresented groups.

The topics chosen for Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems VII are exciting
and currently emerging themes on the borderline between mathematics and physics.
Areas of research of the plenary speakers include: (1) Study of localization of
eigen modes of elliptic operators, which unites deep results in geometric
measure theory and harmonic analysis with modern applications to quantum
physics, noise abatement walls, LEDs, and optical devices; (2) research in
harmonic analysis particularly as connected to applications in medical imaging;
(3) research in symplectic geometry that is nowadays the mathematical basis for
a great many directions in physics; (4) general relativity; and (5) applications
of the tools of complex analysis, which have given a new line of attack on some
of the classical problems in physics, such as Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational
lensing, Laplacian growth, and investigation of Coulomb gases.
