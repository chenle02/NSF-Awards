Tied-back (anchored) retaining walls formerly were used mostly to support
temporary earth excavations. However the use of this type of wall construction
for permanent structures has recently become more widespread, especially along
highway interchanges and as shoreline structures. The advantages of this type of
construction over the more conventional cantilever and gravity walls include
lower cost for large wall heights (over 50 feet), and easier construction.
However, there are at present no rationally-based design procedures in use for
these walls that account for seismic loading. Due to the fact that tied-back
walls have traditionally been used as temporary structures, very little research
has been directed to the seismic design of such structures. This research
project is an analytical investigation of the seismic response of flexible tied-
back retaining walls. It is directed toward determining and quantifying the
mechanisms of earthquake load resistance that develop for this type of retaining
structure. Emphasis is being placed on evaluating the response of systems
comprising a range of wall and anchor geometries, while accounting for inelastic
soil behavior. The interaction effects of the system components (i.e. the wall,
anchors, and soil) during seismic loading is being studied. The improved
understanding of the contributions from various components to the dynamic
response is being incorporated into preliminary design recommendations. These
recommendations lead to a design procedure that accounts rationally for the
effects of earthquake loading.
