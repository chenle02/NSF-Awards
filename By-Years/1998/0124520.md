The proposal plans to connect SIUC to the Illinois Century Network, MREN, and
then to the Abilene Network for research and education purposes: Soybean Genome
Integration and Publication Project requiring real time instructional access to
large remote data sets; Apoliptoprotein Structure Project requiring an advanced
connection due to delay sensitive tranfer of NMR control information and its
latency sensitivy vs. bandwidth requirements; and 3-D vizualization of
Geological Structures
