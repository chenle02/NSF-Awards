The goal of this research is to broaden understanding of the cognitive
development of children using a modeling framework that allows to incorporate
direct measures of investment activity by parents, children, and schools in the
production of the child's cognitive ability from birth through adolescence. The
first project studies the transition of investment in child cognitive ability
from the parents to the child over the development phase. The factors driving
the transition include: the increased productivity of self-investment as the
child ages; increases in the child's future orientation (reflected in age-
specific discount factors that are increasing in age); and (exogenous and
endogenous) changes in the child's role in household decision-making. The PIs
will formulate and estimate both non-cooperative and cooperative models of
interactions between parents and children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second
project investigates the role of formal schooling in the cognitive development
process. As observed in the Child Development Supplement data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, time spent with children declines dramatically
(particularly for mothers) when children begin formal schooling. Within the
modeling framework, schooling is viewed as a new "factor of production" that
enters the child production function when the child first enters formal
schooling. Jointly modeling both school and parental inputs is an important
contribution to a literature which largely considers each in isolation. The CDS-
PSID contains information not only on the geographic location of sample
respondents, but also specific information on the quality of the school that
each child attends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the cognitive
development process and the role that various actors play in it is essential for
the formulation of effective policies to achieve better developmental outcomes.
The PIs will use estimates from these models to perform comparative statics
exercises and counterfactual policy experiments that have the potential to
inform policy, such as the efficacy of parental leaves or the design of
effective unconditional and conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs.
