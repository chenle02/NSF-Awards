General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and
his team will conduct approximately 300 interviews in order to collect data and
then conduct an analysis of that data to further our understanding of how
cultural and political contexts shape the ways people respond to epidemics. The
interviews will be videotaped for public engagement and wider distribution. The
resulting analysis will provide grounded guidance for policy makers and others
seeking to understand the diversity of fears, risk perceptions, preparedness,
and acceptable actions. The Zika epidemic will not likely end soon, though it is
likely that there will be other infectious viruses of global
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
primary goal of this project is the immediate collection of perishable data from
groups in both rural and urban communities in three countries (Argentina,
Mexico, and Brazil). The groups are selected for their importance to the
epidemic processes (transmission and treatment of the disease and of
information), and they include women of childbearing age, medical professionals,
teachers, and youth, as well as the informal sector and the unemployed. The
research team will collect qualitative baseline information on these groups by
conducting approximately 100 interviews per country.
