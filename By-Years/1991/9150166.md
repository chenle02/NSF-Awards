The Education Commission of the States (ECS), with the assistance of the
Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB), and the Association of State
Supervisors of Mathematics (ASSM) plans to link the major reform efforts of the
mathematics community with state-level policy makers. This two-year project will
increase the effectiveness of mathematics education reform by preparing
mathematics leaders to participate in state education policy making, translating
proposed reforms into appropriate state policies and actions, and linking key
mathematics educators with networks of state-level policy makers. Although the
focus is on mathematics education, the infra-structure will be extended to
science education during the course of the project. The implementation plan
includes components on public awareness, data on education policies and reform
efforts by state, enhancement of education leadership activities, networking,
and technical assistance to the states.
