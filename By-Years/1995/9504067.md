9504067 Serene The purpose of this project is to develop parallel algorithms for
many-body calculations for model systems and materials. The first goal is to
elucidate the behavior of phase transitions for these models in self-consistent
perturbation theories. In the vicinity of a phase transition, fluctuations of
arbitrarily large length scales contribute to macroscopic thermodynamic
properties, so large system sizes are required to quantitatively determine the
properties of the phase transitions. In addition, a quantitative description of
a phase transition requires accurate evaluation of small differences between
macroscopically-sized free energies, for which a more accurate algorithm for
evaluating infinite frequency sums was recently developed. This parallel
algorithm can be extended from models to real materials, however the inclusion
of multiple bands and the long-range Coulomb interaction requires substantial
algorithm development. The second goal is to make progress in this direction,
starting with development of algorithms for density response in the Random Phase
Approximation and aiming towards the evaluation of self-consistent GW self-
energies.
