The Museum of Science, Boston, in partnership with Arizona State University, the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Loka Institute, and
Scienceforcitizens.net, is conducting a 1.5-day workshop whose goal is to
strengthen and expand recent cross-sector network-building activities related to
engaging the public in conversations and deliberations about the assessment of
the societal implications of science and technology. In attendance are about
two-dozen participants representing a wide range of informal science education
professionals, STEM researchers, and science policy experts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is focusing on: (1) techniques for citizen
participation in technology assessment, (2) ways in which informal educational
organizations are addressing the intersection of STEM with personal and societal
decision-making, and (3) models for leveraging work done by others who are
exploring public engagement with future technologies. The process will also help
generate and coalesce ideas for the 2012 World-Wide Views on Biodiversity
program, an international effort to engage the public on the topic of world-wide
loss of biodiversity. The workshop outcomes will be evaluated by the Museum's
Research and Evaluation Department.
