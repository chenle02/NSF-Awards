This award will provide support for a one-day conference to be held at
Northeastern University. The workshop will convene thought leaders, researchers,
lecturers, and practitioners in higher education to learn how to more
effectively teach the skill of question formulation in academic research
settings, using the Question Formulation Technique (QFT) developed by the Right
Question Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals of the workshop
include:&lt;br/&gt;1) Provide a hands-on experience of the QFT to practitioners
in higher education.&lt;br/&gt;2) Increase dissemination of the QFT in academic
research settings.&lt;br/&gt;3) Build a network of educators focused on
developing question formulation skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
assist in building a community of practitioners committed to implementing new
approaches for training academics to formulate research questions with
substantive potential for societal impact. Successful scaling of QFT
implementation offers the opportunity for broader impacts through catalyzing
research directions that address pressing societal challenges and
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
