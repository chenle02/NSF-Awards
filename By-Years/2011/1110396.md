Genetic diversity is an important factor that assists in maintaining the health
of a population. Mating behaviors may be one way for organisms to increase the
genetic diversity of a population. For example, if a female mates with multiple
males, her offspring will have greater genetic diversity than a female that
mates with only one male. This project aims to test for multiple mating, and
determine if it assists in increasing disease resistance in a freshwater snail
from New Zealand. Molecular techniques including PCR and microsatellite analysis
will be used to assess paternity. A laboratory experiment will be used to create
single-father and multiple-father families, which will then be tested for
disease resistance. Since multiple paternity has been found in one population,
we expect to find multiple paternity in a second population. We also predict
that multiple paternity will increase the chance that some offspring will be
disease resistant. This research will contribute to many different areas of
scientific research, including how genetics affect disease transmission, the
evolution of reproductive behaviors, and generation of genetic diversity through
mating decisions. Resulting research is intended to contribute to the scientific
community through publishing and presenting results and also to education
through integration of outcomes in undergraduate course work.
