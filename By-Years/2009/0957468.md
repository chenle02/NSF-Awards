In this project the PI will establish the role of short term memory in action
potential duration (APD) restitution and the formation of spatially discordant
alternans (SDA) in the heart using nonlinear spatio-temporal analysis of the
heart's dynamics. The PI will use patch clamp and optical mapping techniques to
perform recording from isolated cells and intact rabbit hearts. In the
theoretical studies, the PI will use a phenomenological mathematical model, as
well as 2D numerical simulations utilizing the recently developed detailed ionic
rabbit ventricular cell model. The first objective of the proposed research is
to demonstrate that the spatial distribution of short-term memory in the heart
correlates with the onset of alternans and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The
second objective of the proposal is to establish inter-ventricular differences
in mechanisms of SDA formation in the heart. Using optical mapping of the
isolated rabbit heart, the PI will test the hypothesis that the formation of SDA
in the right and left ventricles of the heart occurs predominantly through
different mechanisms: steep conduction velocity restitution and short term
memory. The third objective of the research proposal is to assess the specific
roles of short term memory and steep conduction velocity restitution in SDA
formation. The PI will use a pharmacological approach to further tease out the
individual contributions of these mechanisms to SDA formation in the heart. The
project will train graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary
environment. The project will have significant impact on our understanding of
the fundamental causes and precursors of ventricular fibrillation, a major cause
of death in humans.
