This is a one-year test-of-concept program to test the feasibility of a novel
idea for continuous affinity chromatography/membrane process for a
bioseparations. The idea is to use affinity ligands supported in a porous
membrane with the two sides of the membrane operated as a chromatograph. Two
major types of experiments will be done. First, affinity ligands in reversed
micelles contained in a membrane are contacted with the target biomolecule (to
be separated from the solution) in order to form a complex in the reversed
micelle. The system is then eluted under various conditions: flowrates, pH,
temperatures, concentrations, etc. to test for the best separation conditions.
