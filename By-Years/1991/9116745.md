This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Jeremiah Ostriker, Princeton University Observatory, and
Professor Humitaka Sato, Department of Physics, Kyoto University. The project,
which will include Professor Edwin Turner of the Princeton University
Observatory as co-investigator on the U.S. side, brings together American and
Japanese theoretical astrophysicists to study problems connected with the
formation of galaxies and cosmic large scale structure. On the Japanese side,
the research group includes scientists from the National Astronomical
Observatory and the Tokyo Metropolitan University as well as Kyoto University.
Among the studies on galaxy formation to be investigated are: imprints on the
microwave background, phase transition generated structure formation, non-zero
cosmological constant cosmologies, the relation of the intergalactic medium to
background radiation fields, quasar statistics, structure formation by Doppler
instability, gravitational lens statistics, phase transitions in the early
universe, and related topics. Most of these projects will emphasize physics
other than the purely gravitational interactions that have been studied most
thoroughly in the past. It is hoped that this joint study will lead to more
permanent contacts between the two research communities.
