This award provides partial travel support to 17 researchers from academia and
industry to an interdisplinary workshop on ceramics, to be held on July 16-17,
1992, in Las Vegas. Each participant will present a plenary session or a
contributed paper. The workshop will review the present state-of-the-art in the
areas of ceramic powder processing by colloids, aerosols, combustion and other
processes, and will discuss critical issues, needs and research opportunities in
the future. The strength of the meeting will be its interdisciplinary character,
with contributions from different disciplines and from a large spectrum of
industrial processes. It is expected that the preparation of this workshop in
conjunction with the 23rd Annual meeting of the Fine Particle Society will
enhance the participation of a representative group of scientists from the U.S.
and abroad. The workshop recommendations and final report will address research
issues of interest to the scientific community in ceramic powder processing. An
assessment of the state-of-the- art world wide will be made at the conference.
