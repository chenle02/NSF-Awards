This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Effect of Water Soil Matrices
on Heat Transfer Rates in Contaminated Soil Remediation" at Howard University in
support of New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Hazardous Substance Management. This two year project is
reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory Board. The project is studying the
thermal desorption with afterburner destruction in the incineration of soils to
develop a working model for soil decontamination. The model is expected to
predict the conditions for applicability of thermal treatment to site clean up
for the National Site Remediation Program. The Principal Investigators are
competent and have the facilities to perform the research. The Program Manager
recommends Howard University be awarded $99,976 for two (2) years.
