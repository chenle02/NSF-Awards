This award supports the design of a new, world-leading, high power laser user
facility at the University of Rochester. This design project for the facility to
be called EP-OPAL envisions two new powerful lasers to be located at the
university's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR/LLE). EP-OPAL will employ a
technique developed at UR/LLE for the generation of very powerful, ultrashort
laser pulses that was recognized by the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. EP-OPAL
aims to push beyond the current state of the art in peak laser power to achieve
and study extreme physical conditions, such as ultrahigh electromagnetic fields,
temperatures, and pressures that represent the frontier of science in studying
matter in the Universe. Once completed, EP-OPAL will be the highest-power laser
system in the world. The two laser beams combined will deliver approximately the
same total power as incident on the Earthâ€™s surface from the Sun, but focused
into an area smaller than the cross-section of a human hair. The design effort
will engage the U.S. industry to develop critical laser optics and will include
hands-on training of a new generation of laser facility designers and builders.

The EP-OPAL facility design award supports design of two 25-petawatt lasers
using optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification, as well as associated
experimental and diagnostics systems. The design will be guided by the most
pressing scientific questions that can be answered using such a laser system in
four areas of frontier research: Particle Acceleration and Advanced Light
Sources, High-Field Physics and Quantum Electrodynamics, Laboratory Astrophysics
and Planetary Physics, and Laser-Driven Nuclear Physics. Specifically, the main
aims of the project are: (1) design the EP-OPAL facility, including lasers,
experimental systems and diagnostics, to address a wide array of compelling
science; (2) design and prototype high-energy laser amplifiers with shot-cycle
times of a few minutes; (3) design and prototype large-optics production and
characterization systems. The EP-OPAL facility is envisioned to serve as a
learning environment and a hub for diverse scientific networks, offering
opportunities for fundamental research and innovation as well as medical,
industrial and national security applications. The EP-OPAL facility design
effort will engage collaborators at the University of Buffalo, the University of
California - Irvine, the University of Notre Dame, the Ohio State University,
the University of Maryland - College Park, the University of Michigan - Ann
Arbor, and an industrial partner Plymouth Grating Laboratory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
