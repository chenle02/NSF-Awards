The second Undergraduate Conference on Research in Mathematics will be held on
20-21 November 2009 at Penn State University. The conference will consist of
student talks that last 20-minutes in parallel sessions; two plenary speakers,
Aparna Higgins and Art Benjamin; and social events. Students, their faculty
mentors, and other interested faculty will be invited to attend.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will talk about mathematical research in all
branches of mathematics. They will learn about subjects that are new to them,
become better informed about subjects of interest to them, and be better
equipped to make informed decisions about their future careers. Faculty will
learn about the research that undergraduates can complete and how to start or
improve mentoring of undergraduate researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
