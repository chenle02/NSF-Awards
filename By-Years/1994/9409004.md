Mousseau 9409004 The interactions between insects and the plants upon which they
feed and lay eggs are of great interest to both population biologists and
agriculture scientists. This study will investigate egg laying behavior, larval
growth, and survival of the leaf-mining beetle, Brachys tessellatus
(Coleoptera:Buprestidae), known to attack five species of oak trees (Quercus
laevis, Q. marilandica, Q. nigra, Q. incana, and Q. margaretta) in the
southeastern United States. The relative importance of the genetic and
environmental influences on this beetle's preferences for a given tree species
will be determined. Similarly, the genetic and environmental basis to variation
in larval growth and survival on the different trees will be examined. It is
postulated that where a female deposits an egg (w.r.t. tree species) may be the
most important determinant of larval success. This study will also test for a
correlation between a female's preference and the success of her offspring. The
results of this study will provide insights concerning the factors promoting the
specialization of an insect on a given plant, which will have bearing on
questions relating to insect diet breadth, and host-race formation.
