Abstract Proposal: DMS 9803144 Principal Investigator: William P. Minicozzi This
project has two main directions. First, we are studying function theory, for
functions and sections of bundles, on manifolds with a lower curvature bound.
Typically, we are interested in spaces of harmonic functions or sections which
satisfy certain growth conditions on complete noncompact manifolds. As is
evident from our prior research, this problem is closely related to uniform
eigenvalue estimates on compact manifolds for both functions and sections of
bundles. This second problem has an interesting connection to the study of
asymptotics for semiclassical limits in mathematical physics and to questions
which come from complex differential geometry. Second, we are studying
convergence and compactness of minimal surfaces with an emphasis on the case
where there is no a priori area or total curvature bound. If the area of a
sequence of minimal surfaces is unbounded, a classical limit cannot exist;
however, often we can extract geometrically interesting generalized limits.
There are examples where, for topological reasons, such sequences of embedded
minimal surfaces with controlled topology can be constructed. This project has
two main directions both of which involve the interplay between geometry and
analysis. The first direction involves the study of Laplace operators on
manifolds. Our primary interest is in how the basic properties of these
differential operators depend on the geometry of the space. This sort of
question is fundamental and has been relevant in many different areas of
mathematics (including geometry, topology, complex geometry, and mathematical
physics). The second main direction of this project is to study spaces of
minimal surfaces in three manifolds. Minimal surfaces, which are critical points
for area, are interesting physical, geometric, and analytic objects.
