corresponds to a sloshing of water in the equatorial upper Pacific: during an
ENSO cycle water moves back and forth north to south and east to west. This
suggests that the time-mean effects of ENSO are to homogenize the upper ocean
temperature, reducing the east-west and north-south gradients of sea surface
temperature (SST). In more technical terms, it suggests that the eddy heat flux
over ENSO cycles is a significant term in the long-term average heat budget of
the equatorial upper Pacific. Moreover, it is plausible that the eddy heat flux
is down gradient, such that it cools the warm pool, warms the thermocline, and
warms the cold tongue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test this hypothesis, a heat
budget analysis will be carried out using reanalysis data, numerical experiments
will be conducted using an ocean model and a full coupled climate model. Forced
experiments will include subjecting two different ocean models to surface
forcing including and excluding the ENSO signal, and to surface forcing with
different levels or types of ENSO activity. Analyses of the heat-budgets in
these numerical experiments will reveal the effects of ENSO on the mean state,
the relationship between heat fluxes and the thermal variance, and the
relationship between the eddy heat fluxes and the thermal gradients in the mean
state. The coupled experiments are designed to understand and to evaluate the
interaction between the level of ENSO activity and the mean state of the
tropical Pacific. Three models of varying complexity will be used for the
coupled experiments: the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Pacific
basin model coupled to an empirical atmospheric model, the NCAR global ocean
model coupled to an empirical atmosphere, and the NCAR Community Climate System
Model (CCSM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will advance our understanding
of the role of ENSO in maintaining the tropical Pacific climate on decadal or
longer time-scales. On these time-scales, ENSO events are transients, whose
time-mean effects have to be assessed. The resulting knowledge should offer
insights into the causes of tropical biases in simulations by coupled climate
models; it will improve understanding of tropical Pacific climate in past
climates; and it will add to our understanding of how ENSO and the mean tropical
Pacific climate will respond to global warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of this research include an improved understanding of the role of ENSO-a
phenomenon of great public interest-in the climate system. Through Dr. Sun's
teaching and supervision of graduate and postdoctoral students, this research
will contribute to the education, and training of future climate scientists.
