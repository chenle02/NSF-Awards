Research in theoretical physics will encompass a broad program of studies,
including elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, general relativity and
cosmology. Phenomenological Studies will extract the fullest possible
implications of data collected from existing experiments and those anticipated
in the near future. Such work is essential in testing the validity of currently
accepted ideas, such as the Standard Model of elementary particles, and weeding
out alternative schemes which attempt to supplant them. A focus will be on the
low-energy elementary particle phenomena, which are somewhat difficult to
interpret theoretically. Theoretical Studies will involve the formulation of new
theories, and will also deepen our knowledge of existing theories such as
General Relativity, whose content has not yet been explored fully. Finally,
Educational Studies will serve to explain our science in clearly understandable
terms to its practitioners and to students. Such contributions will take the
form of both books and pedagogic articles.
