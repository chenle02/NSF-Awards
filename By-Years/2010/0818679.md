Introduction: The evolutionary origins of our own phylum, the chordates, have
been a topic of intense debate for the past 200 years. Despite broad interest in
the issue, little consensus has emerged from this intense research scrutiny.
Recent advances in our understanding of the relationships between the groups of
animals closely related to chordates, and the technological advances from
molecular genetics, make this key issue much more experimentally tractable. This
work investigates the developmental biology of a phylum called hemichordates,
which is one of the most closely related groups to chordates.
&lt;br/&gt;Approach: This project examines how the mesoderm and endoderm are set
up in this phylum. The mesoderm is a tissue layer that gives rise to many of the
key innovations of our own phylum such as skeleton and the associated complex
musculature. The endoderm gives rise to our complex gut and associated glands.
Expected results: Investigating the role of genes with conserved roles in
inducing and patterning chordate endoderm and mesoderm will help reconstruct the
early evolution of these tissue layers and how they were modified and
diversified to produce the critical morphological structures that define our
phylum. A comparative study of the gene networks involved in endoderm and
mesoderm development will give additional insights into how they function in
vertebrates. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will involve the training
and participation of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of
Chicago. The PI and graduate students will present the results at a broad range
of institutions and internally conferences. &lt;br/&gt;
