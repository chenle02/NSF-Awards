This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Zeroing in on the tissues of the
rice ovule by gene expression profiling using microarray analysis mediated by
laser microdissection." The rice ovule harbors the female archesporial cell that
gives rise to the 7-celled female gametophyte. Laser capture microdissection is
being used to isolate discrete regions of the rice ovule; and RNA from these
microdissected tissues is used for microarray experiments. Microarray analyses
of the rice ovule can greatly contribute to the identification of genes
essential to increased productivity of various rice cultivars.

The Fellow's research capability will be enhanced in plant developmental
biology, functional genomics, and bioinformatics. She will also receive training
in sophisticated genomic technologies: laser-capture microdissection and
microarrays.
