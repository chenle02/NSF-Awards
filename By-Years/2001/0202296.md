Technology educators generally agree that the workplace of today is very
different places than the workplace of yesterday. There is also a general sense
that if a community is to maintain a position of economic strength there must be
fundamental changes in the workplace as well as in the educational programs
which support them. These emerging high performance work environments
increasingly demand technician level employees with sophisticated technical
skills, team skills, and critical thinking skills. It is in response to this
need that our team in the Eastern Iowa Community College District, in
collaboration with 14 public and private sector partners, has created the
Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Center (AMTEC). To address these
workplace changes our team's efforts involve a number of key areas to support
regional workforce needs. We are collaborating with existing ATE manufacturing
programs to develop and deliver an advanced manufacturing technology curriculum
that is responsive to the needs of our regional industries. Our AMTEC has been
developed to have the flexibility to meet the diverse scheduling and learning
style needs of students. We are also establishing a seamless educational pathway
for advanced manufacturing technology education. We are offering three Associate
of Applied Science programs in Industrial Control Systems, Industrial Mechanical
Maintenance, and First Line Supervisor Training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through
professional development opportunities for community college and secondary
school educators we are maintaining and strengthening the region's manufacturing
technician programs. Our state-of-the-art training facility has been developed
to support 340 students in a variety of advanced manufacturing areas. Our
dissemination plans involves an annual Manufacturing Academy for high school
students; a Technicians Speakers Bureau; job shadowing experiences;
Manufacturing Careers program; Manufacturing Seminar for high school vocational
instructors; and a Manufacturing Internship program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
