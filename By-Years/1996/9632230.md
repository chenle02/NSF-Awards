9632230 Treiman This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research will examine the
negotiations between the National Party of South Africa and the black
opposition. It will explore the factors that brought the National Party to the
negotiating table and investigate the role of social movement insurgency and
political parties in "making democracy." The working hypotheses suggests that
black insurgency forced the regime to consider negotiations, while the
reorganization of the party and changes in its constituency made the
negotiations possible. This dissertation will challenge prevailing theoretical
formulations in the literature on democratization which suggests that large-
scale insurgency leads either to elite-aborted democratization, or revolution
from below, both precursor to a reassertion of authoritarianism. This seems to
suggest that ordinary people can, and should, participate in democratizing
states and that elite compromises can lead to win-win outcomes. The researchers
will gather data from both archival sources (state and National Party archives),
in-depth elite interviews. These will be further supplemented with information
from newspapers, secondary literature and survey data. *** ??
