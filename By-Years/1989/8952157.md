Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) gives the chemist a powerful tool
for analyzing mixtures of compounds and monitoring reactions as they progress
The use of GC/MS in the undergraduate laboratory gives students experience with
current instrumental methods for molecular analysis and demonstrates, by
experiment, the concepts of sample preparation, data acquisition and data
manipulation. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) award from
the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at
Colorado State University to acquire GC/MS instrumentation that will be used to
enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
