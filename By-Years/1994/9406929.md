9406929 Phillips The Department of Mathematics at Michigan State University will
purchase a SPARC server 1000 (with processors, hard drives, disk cards, etc.),
and three Sparc 10 workstations. This will supply the needed speed and memory
necessary for the successful completion of the following research projects. (i)
Dirichlet-type Problems with Polynomial Data (ii) Compact Hypersurfaces
Determined by a Spectral Variational Principle (iii) Mathematical Methods for
Population Genetics (iv) Analyses and Computations of Problems in Various
Applications (v) Scalable Algorithms for the Algebraic Eigenproblem
