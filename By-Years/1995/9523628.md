9523628 Chung International Deep Ocean Technology Symposium (1996) is scheduled
to be held tentatively in Los Angeles in the U.S., May 31-June 1, 1996. With the
signing of the UN Law of the Sea Treaty in 1994 by the U.S. and the continuing
research on deep ocean in many countries, this event will provide a timely
occasion for the colleagues to get together and review the progress made in the
last 5 years, and to discuss and summarize what important technological problems
for further research are expected in the next 5 to 10 years, and promote further
cooperation. The primary institutions in the countries, that are most active in
deep-ocean technology research, will participate in this Symposium. ***
