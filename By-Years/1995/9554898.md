The aim of this project is to study the feasibility of creating a pilot program
for the certification of engineering students for teaching in secondary schools.
It is clear that a number of engineering students would choose secondary school
teaching as a career, if the certification requirements would not prevent them
from doing so. Presently there appears to be no effective path to place these
talented and dedicated students into the secondary school classroom. Given the
complexity of the process of secondary teacher certification, the development of
a pilot program for the nation is challenging. Preliminary indications, as a
result of discussions with the North Carolina Board of Education, the personnel
of the Duke teacher certification program , and the Duke University Master of
Arts in Teaching program indicate that the development of a model requires
extensive discussions and evaluations. The project is undertaking the task of
developing a comprehensive and useful pilot program for encouraging engineering
students to enter secondary education.
