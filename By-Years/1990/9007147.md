In this proposal novel in situ infrared analysis system is sought. This system
will be used by a group of five investigators and their students in order to
investigate a number of research projects in the general area of processing of
advanced materials. Several projects in the field of reaction and transport
processes will benefit from the availability of this system. The kinetics of gel
formation before and after the gelation point will be studied with FTIR using
the reaction of multimethacrylates as a model example. The kinetics and
structure of ceramic gels will be studied similarly. The fundamental properties
of GaAs surfaces and Langmuir-Blodgett films will be investigated.
Microelectronic processing will be studied and the distribution of moisture
concentration in epoxy networks will be investigated. Finally, protein
adsorption on polymeric biomaterial will be studied using ATR-FTIR.
