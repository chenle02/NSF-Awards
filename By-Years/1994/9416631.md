9416631 Holbrook A joint US-Danish study of the Southeast Greenland margin to
provide a better understanding of the volcanic rifted continental margins which
contain great thicknesses of mafic igneous material emplaced during continental
breakup. This is an ideal setting to study volcanic rifted margins, because of a
known hotspot and well defined hot spot track, a relatively simple tectonic and
geologic history and a thin postrift sediment cover. Recent ODP drilling and
numerous existing field studies provide additional background data. A
multichannel and wide-angle seismic study in planned with the objectives to
determine the influence of a mantle plume on the rifted margin magmatism, the
detailed structure of the continent- ocean transition, and to compare the
crustal structure of conjugate volcanic margin segments. The data will provide a
framework for interpreting geological and drilling results on the margin and for
constraining thermomechanical models of volcanic rifted margin evolution.
