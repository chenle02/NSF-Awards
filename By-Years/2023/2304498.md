The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to decrease patient referral wait times.
Referral wait times are often long since offices need to retrieve a large amount
of medical information on a patient before they are seen by a doctor.
Unfortunately, medical records are often not stored in one place, making it
difficult to gather the needed medical histories. Quick and complete medical
record retrieval is especially important for cancer patients, whose conditions
can quickly change. Critical patients need to be seen by doctors in a timely
manner to begin treatment. The company is creating a technology that could help
quickly retrieve medical information to decrease the time from referral to
appointment. The company expects these algorithms to expedite document
reconciliation by 7 days, thereby reducing the time from referral for the new
patient appointment by 1 week. By facilitating quicker and more meaningful
record retrieval, the algorithms are expected to improve treatment initiation by
7-14 days. The company plans to commercialize its technology for use in large
academic healthcare systems, first focusing on those with high-volume cancer
centers.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a
new patient referral predictive analytics software platform for cancer centers.
This platform will streamline referrals, increase resource utilization, and
optimize care pathways. The companyâ€™s deep learning algorithms will be developed
to streamline record retrieval for new patient appointments and recognize
critical medical conditions, resource capacity, local referral patterns, and at-
risk socioeconomic factors. This intervention may reduce the mortality risk by
3.2-6.4% per week per patient. To achieve these objectives, the software will
contain two major components a cloud-based platform for medical information
exchange and an machine learning (ML)-based analytics platform. Once fully
developed and launched, it is anticipated that real-world deidentified and
aggregated clinical data from the exchange platform will be used to further
train and refine the ML model. Prior to this stage, data from large publicly
available and multi-institutional databases will be used to provide training
data points for the model.
