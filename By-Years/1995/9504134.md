9504134 Millson The proposed research lies in the interface of topology and
geometry. Working on the classical problem of classifying linkages in space, the
investigator has found connections to representation theory and algebraic
geometry. To be more specific, the proposed research seeks to develop parallels
between the singularities in the representation varieties of Coxeter groups and
the singularities in the deformation spaces of linkages. A linkage in space can
model a robot arm and other rigid structures with joints; a topological
classification of possible linkages in space may turn out to have ramifications
in control theory and robotics.
