9522795 Van Oyen This research focuses on scheduling and release/admission
control in systems for which the production process entails heterogeneous job
types, service times, service delay penalties, and due dates as well as
significant random variability in any or all of the following aspects: arrival
process, job service times, and set-up overhead. In addition, the research
develops models and methods of analysis for system control subject to incomplete
observations of system state information. To achieve this, the research focuses
on the development of an integrated analysis and design methodology to perform
dynamic resource allocation for an extended class of polling models to address
dynamic (state-dependent) control for queuing systems with incomplete state
observations, set-up times/costs, and target production levels. The approach
incorporates three core elements: (1) the characterization of optimal dynamic
policies, (2) the computation of approximately optimal policies, and (3) the
summary of insights gained from theoretical and numerical investigations in a
set of operating principles for a class of problem instances. This research will
culminate in the development of a methodology for the analysis and design of
dynamia control algorithms for the control of queuing systems with incomplete
state observations. Advanced scheduling and production control algorithms
promise to yield significant performance advantages to manufacturing operations
that employ them, provided they are built upon deeply rooted concepts. This
research addresses a class of control problems in queuing networks that center
on scheduling policies (and their interaction with release policies) for systems
with significant switching (set-up) times and incomplete observation of the
system state. The results from this research will impact a class of problems in
resource allocation directly relevant to a broad range of manufacturing
facilities. Moreover, the models, methods, and control algorithms developed will
be u seful in emerging information networks and systems, which contain similar
optimization issues.
