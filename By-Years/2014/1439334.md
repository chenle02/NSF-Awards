The primary goal of the US Ignite is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is
insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of
advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and
dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced
broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there
are few advanced applications and services to justify it. US Ignite applications
are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy
and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency
preparedness. Many of the applications under development in this program build
on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as
part of the NSF GENI program. All of the projects demonstrate the value of
advanced networking. This project supports the 2nd annual US Ignite Application
Summit, an event which will demonstrate the next generation applications
currently being developed, educate a broad community on the potential for next-
generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the
next round of application development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications
Summit is being held June 24-27, 2014, in Sunnyvale, CA. This project supports
academic and student participation in the Summit, and helps offset the costs of
hosting the event and disseminating results.
