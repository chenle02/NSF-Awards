This project will explore the feasibility of a new approach to analyzing the
content of scientific papers which may lead to new quantitative science
indicators and to improved understanding and interpretation of existing
indicators. The content of scientific articles will be broken into "textual
fragments" (such as title, authors, institutional affiliations,
acknowledgements, references, word choice, stylistic elements, and so on), and
"laboratory inscriptions" such as photographs, charts, equations, and the like.
For exploratory purposes analyses will be made of three contrasting groups of
papers in physics and one other field of science -- co-citation clustered
papers, other highly cited papers in the same fields but outside the clusters,
and a sample of non-highly cited papers. If successful the research will suggest
which texual elements may be useful for the development of policy-related
indicators and analyses, and may then become the basis for displays and analyses
in future volumes of Science &amp; Engineering Indicators. The authors will
disseminate their results through a seminar on the methods and the results to be
held at NSF, and through papers to be submitted to an appropriate professional
journal and to the 1988 Annual Meeting of the Society for Social Studies of
Science.
