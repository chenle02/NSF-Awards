The study of water uptake and root cold hardiness at low soil temperatures in
four commercially important tree species (Abies amabilis, A. lasiocarpa, Pinus
contorta and Tsuga mertensiana) from both the Pacific Coast and the Rocky
Mountain regions will result in information with application in basic biology
and woody plant physiology, as well as in applied biology. Basic biological and
physiological applications include (1) an understanding of the tradeoff between
maintenance of root absorptive function at low soil-root temperatures versus the
ability of the root to tolerate cold, subfreezing temperatures and how this
tradeoff influences the success of species, normally associated with continental
and maritime climates, when found in the opposite climatic regime, (2) the role
of low soil temperatures in affecting productivity of mid and high elevation
woody plants and (3) an estimation of the relative importance of belowground as
opposed to aboveground processes in regulating plant/tree function. This study
will have applied application in the areas of forest management and wilderness
and parkland management. Within forest management, particularly given the
mandates of various state and federal regulations (described under the
appropriate Forest Practices Acts), this study will provide information useful
to (1) site selection for regeneration, (2) microsite and site constraints on
regeneration and productivity, (3) an understanding of the role of stand
development on altering site microclimate and the resultant impacts on tree
mortality and (4) the prediction of the impact of site and climate modification
on tree mortality.
