Under the direction of Prof. Joseph Masco, Ph.D. candidate Ella Butler will
undertake an ethnographic study of food scientists, flavor chemists and sensory
scientists working on the development of new, nutritious, appealing processed
foods. Her focus will be on how scientists work to replicate the properties of
taste, flavor and texture of foods if they substitute other ingredients for
sugar or salt through, for instance, phantom aromas, chemicals designed to
stimulate neural pathways to produce imagined sensations. This project works at
the intersection of neurobiology, memory, health, the senses and
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the national concern with the ill effects
of many processed foods on the health of the American population, this study
will be of broad interest. As public commentators, health professionals and
political leaders grapple with how to deal with rising levels of obesity and
diabetes, the processed food industry has received serious criticism. This
anthropological approach will convey the perspectives of the scientists who are
working to craft healthier but still tasty products.
