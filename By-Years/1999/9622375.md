ABSTRACT CTS-9622375 A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) combination
and a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) are acquired. These will be used for
the elucidation of reaction mechanisms of environmentally benign processes.
Specific projects include enhancing resource recovery from polystyrene using
base catalysis; identifying novel high-performance polyimide structures that
exhibit improved thermal stability; and developing robust metal-oxide-based
catalysts for efficient nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction in lean-burn systems.
