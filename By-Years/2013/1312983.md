The research goal of this work is to detect and characterize very low mass white
dwarfs in binary systems, in order to help understand likely Type Ia supernovae
progenitors. About 30-50 new systems will be identified and studied with a new
census of extremely low-mass white dwarfs identified using the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and the Hyper-Velocity Star Survey. This work will provide critical new
insights into the formation and fate of exotic low-mass white dwarfs. It will
also give us new tests of General Relativity and tidal evolution in short-period
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the constituents and history of the
cosmos lies at the heart of modern astrophysics. In the last 15 years,
observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) indicate that the expansion of the
universe is dominated by dark energy. Until we find the progenitors, it is
impossible to understand the systematic uncertainties and to optimize SNe Ia to
definitively explore cosmology. The SNe Ia progenitor problem is therefore a key
problem in astronomy today, and this research promises to add significant
knowledge to our understanding of these exotic systems. The work also has a
broad plan for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral involvement in the
observations, data analysis, and dissemination of results.
