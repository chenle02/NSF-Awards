9711284 Hayes The PI's proposal to develop a high-precision hydrogen isotopic
GCMS represents a relatively risky project that is justified by the preliminary
efforts by the investigator, who is recognized as one of the leading experts in
the development of GCMS instrumentation, and the potential applications of the
instrument in biogeochemical research. The panel believes such an instrument
would quickly become an important tool in numerous studies. In summary, the
panel concludes that funding this effort represents a moderate risk/high benefit
investment.
