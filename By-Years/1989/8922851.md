Gajski Research is on system synthesis where specifications are expressed in
terms of a graphical language called "specification charts". It has sufficient
expressive power to describe IC systems in terms of activities initiated and
terminated by events. Topics are: 1. definition of the specification charts
language; 2. determining how to translate the language into VHDL; 3. algorithms
for partitioning the specifications into system components (e.g. chips) and for
quality estimations using system quality measures; 4. incorporation of interface
synthesis into system synthesis; and 5. evaluation of the tools being developed.
