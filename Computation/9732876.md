DMS 9732876 James Glimm Abstract Mixing layers, internal layers, and fronts are
the primary features of many important fluid flow and solid deformation
problems. The proposers have established striking progress in these areas, and
propose here to develop systematically an effective theoretical and
computational methodology for their study. The central intellectual challenge in
the study of layers and fronts involves the complex interactions of physical
processes with disparate length scales. The length scales of key microscopic
processes within a layer are typically orders of magnitude smaller than those of
the ambient fluid in which the layer is embedded, yet they may have a profound
effect on the macroscopic structure of the fluid flow. For this reason, direct
numerical simulation requires special algorithms to resolve the important layer
microstructure accurately with reasonable computational resources. The
theoretical challenge is two-fold, as the problem requires scale-up techniques
to understand the effects of the microscopic processes at the macroscopic level,
and then methods to express the nonlinear coupling of distinct physical
processes operating on comparable length scales. While the study of layers and
fronts is at least a two-scale problem, the interest here is in practical
applications, which usually involve multiple length scales within a layer. This
project will provide (a) the theoretical and algorithmic basis for a new class
of production codes for the simulation of complex fluid flow and solid
deformation; (b) the theoretical basis for understanding turbulent multiphase
flow and fluid mixing; (c) validation of turbulence and mixing models, through
exploration of parameter regimes in highly resolved simulations that are in step
with physical experiment; and (d) a new mathematical theory for the interaction
of nonlinear hyperbolic waves, including an understanding of phenomena which can
in some cases prevent or overcome the poor perform ance of simulation codes.
When the surface of contact between two distinct materials is unstable, small
random disturbances on the surface will develop into interpenetrating
structures, such as fingers, jets, droplets, and bubbles. These structures are
complex and chaotic, and together they comprise a "mixing layer." Mixing layers
are of fundamental importance in natural phenomena such as supernova explosions,
and in technological applications such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF),
where they are known to be a major limiting factor in the performance of ICF
capsules. Typically a mixing layer is embedded in a large-scale fluid or solid
flow, and in this case the precise resolution of a mixing layer by computer
simulation is impractical (if not impossible) if the computer code is to be used
to make quantitative predictions on a regular basis. For this reason, a
scientific theory is required to capture the unresolvable microstructure of
mixing layers in a macroscopic framework which is amenable to computer
simulation. The goal of this project is to develop such a theory and to
demonstrate its validity by comparison with computer simulation and physical
experiment. This work will require new ideas, as described in this proposal, and
will contribute to the fundamental knowledge base of science, of significance to
a broad range of scientific phenomena.
