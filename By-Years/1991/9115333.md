This project supports a workshop on parallel processing and vectorization at
the Cornell National Supercomputing Facility (CNSF). Eight Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) will send two engineering faculty from each
institution to the workshop. The CNSF supercomputer center will work closely
with these institutions to encourage them to expand the scope of their research
programs by utilizing the advanced computational capabilities of the center. The
participants will have an opportunity to meet and form the basis of future
collaborations with other researchers. Each participant will receive an
allocation of time on the CNSF supercomputer.
