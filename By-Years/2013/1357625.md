The project team is developing a web-based application designed for small group
collaboration around video artifacts. Beyond simply viewing video, this
application is equipped to allow users to dive in and analyze and annotate the
video and to have discussions around the video artifact while either co-located
or distributed. The application is designed to be a system that has features to
enhance collaborative sense-making around video. There are few other systems
designed for groups of people to privately work with video artifacts to
transform the data embedded in video content into information and knowledge that
can be used in creative pursuits and in analytics and decision
making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialization of this technology has the
potential for broad societal impacts. Video capture is already ubiquitous and is
only increasing, leading to millions of hours of video that is under-utilized
across a wide spectrum of domains. This system, if made widely available through
commercialization, can help people to work with video to transform the data in
their video content into information and knowledge. The technology enables
collaborative sense-making that can lead to more creative outcomes in art and
design domains and to better understanding and better decision makings in
complex environments such as medicine, science and defense.
