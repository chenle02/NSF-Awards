9352059 Myers DCCC will establish a Math/Science Learning Lab to improve and
expand the teaching/learning processes of mathematics and science by
incorporating integrated computer technology into every course of instruction.
The lab will be used to present new material to entire classes; stimulate
advanced and independent study activities; provide an environment to produce
laboratory stimulations; enable faculty to use more varied formative and
summative assessment techniques to monitor student progress; implement
specialized software programs for instruction; and shift the emphasis of
teaching to a more conceptual approach. An important additional outcome of this
technologically-advanced learning environment will be to serve as a model to
other undergraduate institutions, particularly community colleges, in creating
new ways to stimulate and enhance learning in math and science.
