This award is for support of a borehole study to determine the mechanisms that
control the movement of antarctic ice- streams and to provide an observational
basis for quantitative modeling of ice stream motions. The objective is an
understanding of the ice stream flow mechanism, including soft-bed deformation
vs. basal sliding as the predominant flow process; flow law of basal till, or
sliding law; nature of the basal water conduit system under the ice streams;
sources of basal water; and lithologic evolution of basal till by erosion and
comminution processes.
