Research is planned in statistical computing, especially on generalized
gradient algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. Regression analysis under
model (link) violation will be studied and the slicing regression technique will
be used to reduce dimension difficulties. Work on Bayesian experimental design
will involve widening classes of priors and investigating minimax, maximin and
sequential designs.
