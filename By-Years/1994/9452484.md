Both teaching and research in plant biology are improved by providing students
with opportunities for investigative experiences in the areas of plant ecology
and physiology. In the required introductory plant biology course, students
measure the effects of environmental variation. Research-based laboratory
modules enhance students' knowledge of physiological processes and of scientific
inquiry. Advanced ecology students study the importance of environmental
variation on primary production in lakes of contrasting water quality.
Experiments designed by ecology students test hypotheses concerning the effects
of environmental variation on plant structure, and research projects may involve
collaborative studies in plant physiology, ecology, and molecular biology.
Students also gain an understanding of plant processes affected by environmental
variation; an improved ability to design, execute, and interpret experiments;
and an increased appreciation of the role of plants in ecological systems.
