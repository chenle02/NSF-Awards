9408716 Coyne Support is granted to faculty at the University of California at
Santa Cruz for continued study of electron-positron interactions at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The research aims to determine parameters of
the standard model of elementary particles. The method makes use of polarized
electrons available only at the SLC colliding-beams complex at SLAC. The group
also will apply to cosmic-ray detection methods used in particle- physics
experiments. The group participates in the design and construction of MILAGRO, a
new air-shower detector that makes use of Cerenkov radiation produced by shower
particles in a large pool of water. With it they will determine properties of
cosmic rays at currently inaccessible energies. ***
