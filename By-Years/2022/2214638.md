This project explores how people decide where to look when searching for valued
outcomes (like products, services, or jobs) when many options are available. One
example is how consumers visit travel websites when booking flights. This
project helps explain the order in which a person would visit travel websites
based on what they expect to find. In a series of online experiments, people are
given choices like those they might face when shopping online, and their data
about location search and choices are recorded. Participantsâ€™ behavior is
summarized by describing the typical decision strategies that they use to make
these decisions. These decision strategies are compared against optimal
mathematical and economic models to identify inefficiencies and errors. Together
the descriptive behavioral findings and the optimal analysis combine to make
recommendations and innovations to improve online search. This research has the
potential to enhance public understanding of online shopping and search
behaviors. It can help government agencies, non-profit organizations, and
corporations improve the design of their websites to help users find what they
are looking for. It can also help consumers search for items online by
highlighting common bad search habits that hinder effective searching. Finally,
while this research focuses on consumer search, people search for many other
things, jobs, opportunities, and services and the findings can be applied to
these other situations as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores how
people navigate as they search sequentially for the best outcomes in an
environment defined by search costs and differing expectations for outcomes at
different locations. The goal of this research is to understand the strategies
that people use to decide where to look for good outcomes based on search costs
and their expectations (i.e., navigation). Studies compare observed strategies
to normative economic models of navigation. This proposal is distinctive because
it: (A) examines navigation behavior in the context of sequential search using
controlled experiments; (B) compares navigation behaviors against the
predictions of an influential optimal search model (Weitzman, 1979); (C)
examines cognitive strategies used by people as they navigate in search; (D)
develops a novel experimental method that allows comparing navigation behaviors
to predictions from normative models and to identify simplifying heuristics; and
(E) utilizes agent-based models to understand the adaptive nature of search
heuristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
