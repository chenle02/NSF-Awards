9632171 Kurtz This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
(GOALI) project will provide a close University-Industry interaction with
Hewlett-Packard Laboratories (HP) and faculty and graduate students at Louisiana
State University. The research will focus on mechanisms underlying giant
magnetoresistance (GMR) and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). These phenomena
are of considerable interest in the context of high density magnetic storage
media. The films will be prepared at HP and characterization at the LSU Center
for Advanced Microstructures Devices (CAMD). The CAMDE synchrotron light source
will be used to study the electronic structure and Fermi surface properties of
industrially relevant materials. The results will be of fundamental interest and
should also lead to the development of improved materials. %%% This Grant
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research will develop a
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying magnetic and resistive
properties of materials used magnetic storage media like computer hard drives.
The collaboration involves Hewlett-Packard Laboratories (production of thin film
hetero-structures) and the Louisiana State University's Center for Advanced
Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) (film characterization using photoelectron
spectroscopy). The materials of interest include giant magnetoresistive (GMR)
hetero-structures and colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) perovskites. ***
