This project is designed to provide a mechanism for the National Governors
Association to work with Governors and other state policy makers and assist them
in becoming advocates for mathematics and science education reform through
systemic strategies. A conference joined to meetings of the Education Commission
of the States will bring together the key players from the states to present and
discuss the issues at hand. A number of follow-up activities will enhance the
efforts made at the conference by networking the participants in a nationwide
effort to incorporate systemic strategies into education reform.
