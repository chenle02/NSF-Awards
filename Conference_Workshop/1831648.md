This award provides partial support for the 33rd Summer Conference on Topology
and its Applications, to be held July 17-20, 2018, at Western Kentucky
University. This conference series showcases advances in topology and
applications to areas such as algebra, analysis, and computer science. Special
sessions in topology applied to materials properties and in knot theory applied
to the physical science will provide opportunities to foster interdisciplinary
collaborations. To encourage scientific awareness in the community, Michael
Kosterlitz, 2016 Nobel Laureate in Physics, will deliver a public lecture on
applications of topology in physics. Each of the seven special sessions will
include presentations by students, early career researchers, and established
scholars, and will encourage participation from women and scholars from
underrepresented groups. The peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings will
have a special issue for papers presented at this conference. The conference
will have special sessions in Topology in Analysis and Topological Algebras
(dedicated to W. W. Comfort), Set-theoretic Topology, Topological Methods in
Geometric Group Theory, Dynamical Systems and Continuum Theory, Asymmetric
Topology, Applications of Knot Theory to Physical Sciences, and The Interplay of
Topology and Materials Properties. To foster the sharing of ideas across the
sub-disciplines, each session will have a plenary speaker. Besides the
applications within mathematics included in all sessions, these sessions will
include interdisciplinary applications to physics (Materials Properties),
biology (Knot Theory), and computer science (Asymmetric Topology). Further
details are available at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
