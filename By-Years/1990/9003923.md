This Gordon Research Conference on the Chemical Senses will provide a forum for
experts in the field to informally discuss the latest data and concepts that are
emerging in focused target areas of high current interest. Each discussion
session will include ample time for open active interchange after each
presentation by a speaker. The free exchange of ideas at these conferences has
traditionally been a large factor in their stimulation of the field to push at
the frontiers. This conference will have impact on areas of cellular and
behavioral neuroscience extending beyond simply chemosensory science.
